Lightme - Logbook doesn't collect or store any of its users' data.
All of the information the user inputs is stored locally on its personal device and (if iCloud synchronisation is enabled for the app) on the user's personal iCloud storage.
The information relative to the location of the shots is treated in the same manner, be it recorded via automatic location services or manually dialed in.
No information other than what is manually and explicitly input by the user is stored, with the only exception of a simple launch counter that will be only stored locally on the user's device.
