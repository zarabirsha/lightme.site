         <b>Lightme - Lightmeter</b> is a clean, simple to use yet very powerful lightmeter.<br><br>
         It is optimised for an <b>easy one-handed use</b>, both for left-handed and right-handed users, with the main
         controls
         within your thumb's reach, without the fatiguing juggling of your precious smartphone.<br><br>
         A core distinguishing feature of Lightme - Lightmeter is that - differently from most of the other apps - it
         can
         show <b>multiple combinations</b> of valid settings for aperture and shutterspeed at the same time by working
         like a -
         stretched out - old needle and wheel lightmeter. This allows the user to quickly pick the desired settings
         without having to scroll on a tiny wheel picker. <br><br>
         The app is designed to be welcoming to people who are just starting out, with a simple one-button use. But it
         offers many useful and advanced features for the more experienced shooters/users:<br>
         <ul>
            <li>Continuous metering (by pressing and holding or double tapping the measure button)</li>
            <li><b>Spot metering</b> with a variable zoom (for more precision) which also supports <b>average
                  metering</b>,
               and a
               very
               intuitive implementation of the <b>zone system</b></li>
            <li>Automatic <b>reciprocity failure compensation</b> (for 25+ films, if you see exposure times in red,
               they
               are
               being compensated)</li>
            <li>A dedicated <b>pinhole mode</b> with precise exposure times for user defined apertures (multiple
               apertures
               at
               a time), with the possibility of setting a timer (through a shortcut)</li>
            <li><b>Incident light metering</b> with calibration when using the front facing camera</li>
            <li>And more ...
         </ul>
         It also includes some other features that are enjoyable by any kind of user:<br>
         <ul>
            <li>Black and white preview</li>
            <li>The ability to use any of the cameras on your smartphone (swipe left/right on the preview)</li>
            <li>Multiple <b>presets</b> for your different camera/film/lens setups</li>
            <li><b>Framelines</b> for previewing your shot, before setting up your tripod etc.</li>
            <li>A searchable list of useful <b>tips</b> to make better use of the application's potential</li>
            <li> A searchable list of more than 70 films to choose from with the possibility of selecting a few
               favourites</li>
            <li>Dark mode support and a useful level of customisation</li>
         </ul>

         You can find even more info in the tips inside the app or you can have a look at full <b>user manual</b> by
         tapping on
         manual (in the settings)<br><br>
         The app is <b>free</b> in all its many functionalities, but it offers In-App-Purchases in order to support the
         project.<br><br>
         The only minor perk you can enable only via certain IAPs is the replacement of the Ad button with a label
         containing the name of your current preset, check under settings -> coffee for more info.<br><br>
         Don't panic though, even if there's an Ad button it doesn't mean I'm going to show you ads. In fact unless you
         decide to tap on that button I'm never going to show you any. But if you have a few minutes to spare, watching
         a few of them sure helps keeping this project alive :) <br><br>
         Try it, and, if you like it, share it with your friends and consider writing a (mini) review ;)<br><br>

         Have a nice day, and good light!<br><br>

         <b>Lightme - Logbook</b> is a clean and powerful tool to record and keep track of your rolls and shots, as well
         as other gear and consumables that revolves around the process of shooting and developing film.<br><br>
         The aim of the project is to build something beautiful, yet very functional and immediate, with the goal of
         both reducing the effort taken to record each shot/roll as well as allowing a sufficient level of flexibility
         and covering various scenarios.<br><br>
         The app will offer a few key features, together with the main logging activity you may expect from a digital
         logbook:
         <ul>
            <li>
               The possibility of reviewing the stored information in different aggregated forms, i.e. by allowing to
               build some interesting graphs/histogams based on fields and data filtered according to user-defined
               criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
               Data export for various "searches" in formats like json or csv
            </li>
            <li>
               A way to keep track of your stock film and developer mixes inventory, with expiring dates and related
               notifications
            </li>
            <li>
               A straight-forward way of keeping track of large format film-holders with three possible states
               (unloaded, loaded and exposed) and info about either the film or the shot that is inside them.
            </li>
            <li>
               Post development notes for rolls, sheets and shots, also allowing to add a further photo to record also
               the final results.
            </li>
         </ul>
